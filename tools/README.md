# tools/

Dev-only tooling. Nothing here is part of the reading list itself, and no command
in this directory ever writes a `20xx.md` year list.

For Node/Python/Docker prerequisites, pinned browser dependencies, read-only
preflight and the PR validation gate, start with the
[maintainer setup checklist](MAINTAINING.md).

There are **two archive** tools, and they preserve different things. Getting them mixed up
is the easiest mistake to make here, because both end up producing PDFs:

| Tool | Preserves | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`capture_pdf.py`** | the **announcement posts** — each year's nominee list and the post naming the winning ten | [`original-listings/`](../original-listings/) |
| **`references/`** | the **cited research itself** — every technique the year lists link to | `archived-references/` |

So `capture_pdf.py` archives the *index* of the list; `references/` archives the
*articles on it*. This file documents the first. For the second see
[`references/README.md`](references/README.md).

## Skill compatibility check

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
python3 tools/check_skills.py --strict
```

Checks every `SKILL.md` in `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` against
[Anthropic's authoring requirements](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices)
and the [Agent Skills format](https://agentskills.io/specification): valid YAML
without duplicate keys, portable frontmatter fields, matching directory/name,
name syntax and reserved words, non-empty descriptions, no XML in discovery
metadata, and limits of 64 characters for names, 1,024 for descriptions and 500
for optional compatibility text. Optional `metadata` maps strings to strings;
the specifications do not state a separate size cap for that map.

The checker also verifies explicit local Markdown links in the entrypoint and
reports skills at or above the recommended 500-line threshold. That threshold
is authoring guidance, not a metadata hard limit; `--strict` makes it fail the
local check. Review trigger clarity, examples, reference navigation and runtime
prerequisites separately; static validation cannot prove skill behaviour.

These are repository workflows: their scripts and Codex adapters require this
checkout. Passing this check does not make each folder a standalone Claude.ai
upload or test its execution in Claude. Claude Code has additional frontmatter
fields, but [portable uploads accept only the shared fields](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#using-skill-frontmatter-outside-claude-code).

## capture_pdf.py

### Setup

- **Python 3.10+** and **Docker**.
- The approved toolbox supplies Chromium, Poppler and the document parsers.
  No host browser, browser profile or host `pypdf` is used for source material.

```bash
python tools/capture_pdf.py doctor --smoke
```

`doctor` reports container availability and archive counts. `--smoke` additionally
captures `example.com`, which proves the whole path works before you blame a
source page.

### Everyday use

```bash
python tools/capture_pdf.py list                  # manifest, and what is present
python tools/capture_pdf.py run                   # capture whatever is missing
python tools/capture_pdf.py run --only 2025        # just one year
python tools/capture_pdf.py run --kind nominees    # just the nominee lists
python tools/capture_pdf.py run --dry-run          # what would happen
python tools/capture_pdf.py run --force            # re-capture, overwriting
python tools/capture_pdf.py verify                 # check the whole archive
python tools/capture_pdf.py text FILE.pdf --grep "one,two"
python tools/capture_pdf.py url URL OUT.pdf        # something not in the manifest
```

`run` skips entries that already have a PDF, so it is cheap to repeat and safe to
re-run after adding a year. `--manifest` and `--outdir` point either command
somewhere else, which is also how you try a capture without touching the real
archive:

```bash
python tools/capture_pdf.py run --only 2025 --outdir /tmp/try
python tools/capture_pdf.py verify --only 2025 --outdir /tmp/try
```

Exit codes are meaningful: `run` and `verify` return non-zero if any file is
missing, thin, or fails its content assertions.

### Adding a year

Append to [`sources.json`](sources.json) and capture it:

```json
{
  "year": "2026",
  "kind": "nominees",
  "url": "https://portswigger.net/research/top-10-web-hacking-techniques-of-2026-nominations-open",
  "note": "Full nominee list for 2026.",
  "expect": ["nomination", "2026"]
}
```

```bash
python tools/capture_pdf.py run --only 2026
python tools/capture_pdf.py verify
```

Fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `year` | Groups the files. `2016-17` is one "year", matching `2016-17.md`. |
| `kind` | `nominees`, `top10`, or an explanatory variant (`voting`, `finalists`, `nominees-and-top10`) when that year's process did not split into two pages. Free text — the output file is `<year>-<kind>.pdf`. |
| `url` | What actually gets rendered. May be a `web.archive.org` replay. |
| `original_url` | The dead original, when `url` is a replay. Recorded, never fetched. |
| `note` | Why this page, and any snapshot caveat. |
| `expect` | Strings that must appear in the rendered PDF's extracted text. |
| `scale`, `settle` | Optional per-entry overrides. |

**`expect` is the part worth caring about.** A capture that renders a 404, a
consent wall or a nominations-stage snapshot with no winners still produces a
perfectly tidy PDF. Naming a couple of strings only the real page contains — the
#1 technique, a section heading — turns that from an invisible problem into a
`SUSPECT` row. Matching is case-insensitive and whitespace-normalised, because
justified text extracts with stray non-breaking spaces.

### How the capture works, and why not `--print-to-pdf`

`chrome --headless --print-to-pdf URL` is one line and gets this wrong: it prints
through the site's **print** stylesheet, which on these pages drops the content —
a nominee list is exactly the sort of thing print CSS hides — and it cannot
scroll, so lazy-loaded images never arrive.

So the browser is driven over the DevTools Protocol instead, by
[`references/refslib/browser.py`](references/refslib/browser.py), which already
owned a hardened browser lifecycle for the other tool. `capture_pdf.py` supplies
the archival policy and calls `Ladder.render_url_pdf()`:

- **`screen` media is emulated**, so pages archive as a reader saw them.
- **The page is scrolled top to bottom** and `document.images` awaited, forcing
  lazy images to load.
- **Furniture is removed**: the Wayback Machine toolbar (injected into every
  replayed page), cookie walls, newsletter modals.
- **`fixed`/`sticky` elements are demoted to `static`**, or the site header
  reprints on every page of the PDF and covers the text under it.
- **`<details>` blocks are opened**, or they print as a summary line and silently
  lose their body.
- **The real HTTP status is recorded** via the navigation timing entry, so a
  silently-404ing URL is visible in the provenance log.
- **Archive replays get a longer settle** automatically, since a replay waits on
  the archive as well as the page.

Pages are printed to A4 at `scale: 0.7`. That is deliberate rather than cosmetic:
`printToPDF` lays out at the paper width, so A4 alone gives Chrome ~794 CSS px
and a mobile breakpoint. At 0.7 it lays out at ~1100 px and renders that at 70% —
a desktop layout at a readable size.

The browser gets a throwaway profile inside a non-root, read-only container.
Direct networking is disabled; public requests use the separate destination-
checking broker in `references/refslib/gateway.py`. Offline PDF reading has no
network route. The host owns durable publication and removes exact container IDs
on completion or timeout. Source handling and semantic review follow
[the shared security policy](../.claude/source-security.md).

### Provenance

[`capture-report.json`](capture-report.json) records, per file: source URL, HTTP
status, byte size, page count, extracted-text length, capture timestamp, and any
`expect` string that was missing. It is rewritten incrementally as `run`
progresses, so an interrupted run still leaves a truthful record.

### Tests

Both tools share one suite:

```bash
python -m pytest tools/references/tests -q
```

Everything about the capture path that can be proved without launching a browser
is in `tests/test_capture_listings.py` — the guards, the option assembly, the
archival policy, and the manifest's agreement with what is actually on disk. For
the parts that need a real browser, use `doctor --smoke`.
